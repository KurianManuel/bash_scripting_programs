# Bash Script Repository

## Overview

The **Bash Script Repository** is a collection of versatile Bash scripts designed to automate various tasks related to file management, user monitoring, and system integrity checks. This repository aims to provide users with efficient tools to enhance productivity and maintain system security in a Unix-like environment.

## Key Functionalities

1. **File Creation in Specified Directories**: Users can create files in designated directories, facilitating organized file management.

2. **Directory Listing**: The scripts allow users to display a list of all files present in a specified directory, making it easy to navigate and manage files.

3. **User  Login Count**: The system provides functionality to display the current count of users logged into the system, offering insights into user activity.

4. **File Details Display**: Users can print the names and details of files within a specified directory, enhancing their ability to manage and understand their data.

5. **Custom Input Analysis**: A custom function is implemented to count lines, words, and characters in user-provided input without relying on external tools like `wc`, providing a tailored solution for text analysis.

6. **Reverse Printing of Glossary Files**: The scripts read a glossary file and print its contents in reverse order using arrays, demonstrating effective data handling techniques.

7. **Real-Time User Monitoring**: The system continuously checks if a user has logged in every 30 seconds, ensuring that administrators are aware of user activity in real-time.

8. **Security Checks**: The scripts implement measures to prevent unauthorized escalation to root privileges and verify root access, enhancing system security.

9. **File Integrity Testing**: Hashing algorithms are used to verify the integrity of files, ensuring that critical data remains unaltered and secure.

10. **Running Shell Script Monitoring**: The scripts monitor the system for any currently running shell scripts, providing visibility into ongoing processes and enhancing system management.
